# Introduction
My simple 2d physics engine for rectangular rigid body objects.
- It simply implements basic laws of rigid body physics. (momentum, impulse, inertia, torque, friction, repulsive force)
- You can see interesting results by changing some parts of code. (For example, by changing the sign of force of friction, all objects will slide and fly away.)
- This project is based on C++ and SDL library. (In other words, I never used other 2D physics engines.)
